# Disk-Scheduling-Algorithm-Simulator
This is my 4th year 1st semester's project using PL/SQL of Oracle. In this project, there were two sites one using my PC(server-Site2) and another was created using VMware (Site-1). User get the results by providing only the input values for Disk Scheduling Algorithms- FCFS, SCAN, C SCAN, LOOK, C LOOK from Site-1 and the calculatation is done on the server side(Site-2) and shows output on site1.
